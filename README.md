This was my second project in my CIS 2300 "Programming and Computational Thinking" led by professor Sadat Chowdhury

# Project Description

Suppose that the letters of the English alphabet are assigned the following values: 

| Letter              | Score |
|---------------------|-------|
| a,e,i,o,u,n,r,t,l,s | 1     |
| d,g                 | 2     |
| b,c,m,p             | 3     |
| f,h,v,w,y           | 4     |
| k                   | 5     |
| j,x                 | 8     |
| q, z                | 10    |


Next, let us define the value of a word as the sum of values of all its letters. Thus, the word "cat" has a value of c+a+t = 3+1+1 = 5.

The following program calculates and prints out the value of "cat":

```python

# define variables for letter values that I need:
a = 1
t = 1
c = 3


# calculate (compute) the value for : 'cat'
value = c+a+t

# print out the value
print(value)

```

For this project, I had to modify the given program (main.py) to calculate and print out the the value of the 7 letter unique word I entered in the online form at the beginning of the semester. My program outputed the result (a number) and nothing else.
